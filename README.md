## Custom battery level notification for Chrome OS

### Features
- Set a custom battery level that you want to trigger a notification for it
- If you always ignore the low battery notifications (just like meðŸ˜€), this extension also provides an option to show a fullscreen warning so that you can't ignore it anymore :)
#### Coming soon
<sup><i>Might take forever to implement if nobody request it :)</i></sup>
- Custom notification icon
- Custom message (fullscreen warning/notification)

### So, how to install this?
- Download [archive](https://github.com/supechicken/ChromeOS-Battery/archive/refs/tags/main.zip) of this repository and unzip it
- Unpack the zip file by:
  - Double click the zip file in the file manager. The zip file will show contents in what looks like a flash drive
  - Drag the folder within the zip file into the Downloads folder
  - Optionally delete the zip file
- Go to [`chrome://extensions`](chrome://extensions) and enable `Developer Mode` (don't confuse with the **Chrome OS developer mode**, they are not the same thing)
- Click "Pack Extension", click "Browse" under "Extension Root Directory", then click on the folder named `ChromeOS-Battery-main`, and click <kbd>Open</kbd>
- Click "Pack Extension", then click <kbd>OK</kbd>
- Open the file manager, go to Downloads and drag the `.crx` file into the `chrome://extensions` window.
- Click <kbd>Add Extension</kbd>
- Optionally delete the generated `.crx` packaged file and `.pem` key file

### Why not uploading it to Chrome Web Store?
Uploading to Chrome Web Store requires a credit/debit card to pay a one-time registration fee, and it only accepts credit/debit card only. The issue is I don't have any credit/debit card (I am only 14) :/
